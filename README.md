# Java Brick Breaker Game (Super Brick Breaker)
  
**Description:** This program is similar to the classic arcade game [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)). It implements [Javax](https://www.baeldung.com/java-packages-vs-javax) technology for the game frame and various player, opponent, and scoring elements, and is split into multiple class files to promote clean organization/division of the main program driver, gameplay, and map generator logic.
